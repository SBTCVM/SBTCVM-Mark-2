What's this? this is the extra's directory. 

it has some stuff that doesn't really fit anywhere else. 

such as some Gimp palettes for simulating some balanced ternary greyscale
modes and 3-trit RGB color.

speaking of 3-trit RGB some 27x27 3-trit RGB icons are also found here.

also you will find recources relating to things like SBTCVM's Logo.

see what else you can find.
