Information On compatibility with past SBTCVM programs:


SBTCVM Mark 2 is NOT compatible with mark 1 or mark 1.1 TROMs (programs)

Reasons include:
the old 1.x opcodes now use slightly different opcodes and data syntax.
opcodes were modified as such:

--LLLL where LLLL is the 1.x opcode.

also functions such as the TTY write and raster fields and the buzzer and
other opcodes sill expecting 6-trit data have been padded as such:

???LLLLLL where LLLLLL is the legacy data.

Other opcodes have been changed and now run using all 9 trits of data.

for example addressing and mathematical operations are now done in 9 trits instead of 6.

IObanklist has been redesigned. since It was not implemented as anything other than
scratch memory in previous SBTCVM versions.

see IObanklist-summary.txt



if the tasm source is available, one might be able to retool the source.
