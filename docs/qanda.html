              Well... You are looking in the right place. The HTML
              documentation is the best place to start.&nbsp; A decent
              understanding of balanced ternary won't hurt.&nbsp; Also,
              you may find the main menu launcher interesting.
              MK2-MENU.py is a graphical menu with Demos, an
              introduction, and even a number guessing game that uses
              SBTCVM's random integer port.<br>

              Fast enough to run hundreds and even thousands of

              widely. <br>
              (if your curious, try running benchmark1.trom with
              MK2-RUN.py's -le option, and look at the bottom of the
              resulting execution log in the CAP directory.)<br>

              How can SBTCVM and its utilities preform balanced ternary
              integer mathematics?<br>
              <br>
            </td>
            <td valign="top">A:<br>
              SBTCVM uses a instruction level tactic towards its VM
              design. meaning it interprets the VM program code using
              high level logic, Thus avoiding slow, complex, circuit
              emulation.<br>
              <br>
              That's why SBTCVM is able to get such high speed
              operation. its mimicking the functionality of a mythical
              balanced ternary microprocessor and accompanying computer
              that doesn't even exist as a circuit diagram at this
              point.<br>
              <br>
              of course SBTCVM needs some special support code to do
              that. and one of the key libraries, in fact arguably the
              most important, libbaltcalc. <br>
              <br>
              libbaltcalc of course, works by using high-speed balanced
              ternary to decimal conversion, and decimal to balanced
              ternary conversion, to preform mathematical operations in
              decimal, thus using python's existing mathematics routines
              to quickly preform operations. those conversion routines
              are also used quite heavily by SBTCVM.<br>

              <b><a name="Q10"></a><a href="#Q10">Q10:</a></b><br>
              SBTCVM is too fast for me to debug my trom! (see notes)<br>
              <b><a name="Q11"></a><a href="#Q11">Q11:</a></b><br>
              SBTCVM uses too much CPU!<br>
              <b><a name="Q12"></a><a href="#Q12">Q12:</a></b><br>
              Is there a frame skip setting?<br>
            </td>
            <td valign="top"><b>TTY rendering</b><br>
              Well, if you use the command shell (MK2-CS.py) alot, you
              might consider turning off the TTY rendering (its kinda
              slow). <br>
              in USERBOOT.CFG (its created on first-run of the VM in
              VMUSER)<br>
              find the line: "#ttystyle=0" and set it to "ttystyle=1"<br>
              <br>
              <b>CPU Wait time<br>
                <br>
              </b>The amount of time per cycle to sleep in seconds (as a
              floating point number)<br>
              <br>
              You may try, if your computer is fast enough, shortening
              the cpu delay.<br>
              find the line "#CPUWAIT=(0.0005)" and uncomment it, and
              try changing the time to a shorter time <br>
              <br>
              likewise, if SBTCVM is using too much CPU for your taste,
              try making this time longer. <br>
              <br>
              <b>Frame Skipping</b><br>
              <br>
              number of clock cycles to wait between display updates.<br>
              <br>
              also you can try setting fskip (find the line "#fskip=1")
              to a higher number. by default fskip is set to 1, that
              means that every other clock cycle's frame is rendered. if
              you have say an average operations/second of 2000, you
              might try fskip=100, as with 2000 operations/second, by
              default the display is being updated 1000 times a
              second.&nbsp; so yea, fskip is worth adjusting a bit.<br>
              <br>
              <b>notes:</b><br>
              <ul>
                <li>The data readouts are disabled by default for speed
                  reasons. toggle them with F4.</li>
                <li>if your debugging a trom, try F2, this helps step
                  through a program manually by pressing return, though
                  the keyscan system doesn't work in this mode. press F2
                  again to return to normal execution.</li>
                <li>using MK2-RUN.py's -tos option will give you an
                  approx operations/second tally. note that execution
                  logging (MK2-RUN.py -le) also reports this in the
                  resulting log file, but it does slow down the VM
                  somewhat from normal due to the per-cycle status
                  reporting to the log.<br>
                </li>
              </ul>
