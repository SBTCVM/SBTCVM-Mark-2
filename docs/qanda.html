              Well... You are looking in the right place. The HTML
              documentation is the best place to start.&nbsp; A decent
              understanding of balanced ternary won't hurt.&nbsp; Also,
              you may find the main menu launcher interesting.
              MK2-MENU.py is a graphical menu with Demos, an
              introduction, and even a number guessing game that uses
              SBTCVM's random integer port.<br>

              A balanced ternary virtual machine written in
              python.&nbsp; It's not a simple program. Not a common type
              of program either.<br>

            <td valign="top">A:<br>
              Fast enough to run hundreds of operations a second.&nbsp;
              Its exact speed will vary. <br>
              (if your curious, try running benchmark1.trom with
              MK2-RUN.py's -le option, and look at the bottom of the
              resulting execution log in the CAP directory.)<br>

              How does SBTCVM work?<br>
              Q6:<br>
              Why is SBTCVM so fast?<br>
              Q7:<br>
              How is this even possible in python again?<br>
              Q8: <br>
              How does SBTCVM and its utilities preform balanced ternary
              integer mathematics?<br>
              <br>
            </td>
            <td valign="top">A:<br>
              SBTCVM uses a instruction level tactic towards its VM
              design. meaning it interprets the VM program code using
              high level logic, Thus avoiding slow, complex, circuit
              emulation.<br>
              <br>
              That's why SBTCVM is able to get such high speed
              operation. its mimicking the functionality of a mythical
              balanced ternary microprocessor and accompanying computer
              that doesn't even exist as a circuit diagram at this
              point.<br>
              <br>
              of course SBTCVM needs some special support code to do
              that. and one of the key libraries, in fact arguably the
              most important, libbaltcalc. <br>
              <br>
              libbaltcalc of course, works by using high-speed balanced
              ternary to decimal conversion, and decimal to balanced
              ternary conversion, to preform mathematical operations in
              decimal, thus using python's existing mathematics routines
              to quickly preform operations. those conversion routines
              are also used quite heavily by SBTCVM.<br>
