      <div align="left">SBTCVM is quite the complex project.&nbsp; A
        great way to get it moving along further is helping out
        development.&nbsp; You don't even need to be an expert at
        programming or computers, simply testing code and helping with
        documentation, or simply spreading the word to interested people
        can help quite a lot.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        However if you are skilled in programming, (specifically
        python), and know about balanced ternary or are curious about it
        and willing to learn,&nbsp; SBTCVM can use more development
        skills.&nbsp; here is a overview of the kinds of help the SBTCVM
        project can use:<br>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>help with Documentation. users with basic knowledge of
            Balanced ternary are preferred.</li>
          <li>help with Designing and improving SBTCVM's utilities and
            related tools.&nbsp; You see, due to the sheer lack of tools
            related to balanced ternary,&nbsp; the SBTCVM project has
            had to write many tools such as an assembler, launchers, and
            such, and many more utilities will likely need to be written
            as SBTCVM evolves, and grows more advanced.</li>
          <li>help with designing and implementing SBTCVM's core
            architecture.&nbsp; Due to the sheer lack of reference on
            balanced ternary computer design, trial and error, and
            research, are expected.&nbsp; <br>
          </li>
          <li>SBTCVM is a ways away from running a practical, useful,
            Operating system, but with enough work, perhaps SBTCVM will
            provide an example of that as well.</li>
          <li>Due to SBTCVM's complexity, help in the overall design
            from knowledgeable people would be appreciated. <br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Software to run in SBTCVM would be easier to develop with
            a reasonably high level, portable, programming language
            designed for balanced ternary computers.<br>
