	<title>VM User Interface Overview</title>
	<text>The following covers the basic User interface of the VM.</text>
	<title>The TTY</title>
	<img>UI1.jpg</img>
	<text>The largest and most obvious part is the TTY.  It uses SBTCVM's SBTCVM-BTT-6 encoding, and offers both 9x9 and 9x18 fonts. Another important function of the TTY is printing Status messages such as when something goes awry. The Users manual lists these messages in detail.</text>
	<title>Plotters</title>
	<img>UI2.jpg</img>
	<text>SBTCVM's prototype introduced two "plotter-like" graphics displays. The greatest limitation they have is they lack any sort of framebuffer. These displays still remain in SBTCVM Mark 2, and remain unchanged despite the jump from 6 to 9 trits. the top one is 27x27 pixels and can display 729 colors (6-trit RGB). the lower one is only 9x9 pixels, and is 2-trit greyscale. Yes, their usefulness varies... But they remain nonetheless, and likely will remain for the duration of the Mark 2.0.x series. A much larger plotter mode is planned for SBTCVM's in-planning graphics adapter, (SBTGA)</text>
	<title>Status Area</title>
	<img>UI3.jpg</img>
	<text>And finally we have the status area. when enabled, the status readouts display the state of various registers. By color: cyan: instruction, green: data, red violet: ram bank (A-F), blue violet: thread, pink: register 1, orange: register 2, blue: execution address. These are disabled by default outside the main menu, but can be toggled with F4 and fully enabled using settings.py. Also you will see the CPU status LED; cyan=on, orange=standby, and the step-by-step mode LED. Again, The users manual goes into more detail.</text>
