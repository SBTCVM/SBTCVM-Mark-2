The SBTCVM Command Shell is an important part of SBTCVM.
Though it can be daunting for new users to get a grasp on. In this tutorial,
You will be guided through the most key parts of the command shell.
The Command shell, when properly run from a terminal, will print out some text like
above.
Now. lets get you stared. To run the command shell. simply run MK2-CS.py in
a terminal.  This will vary depending on your operating system. So check the
internet for information on how to do this in your operating system.

	<text>:list streg
VMSYSTEM/ROMS/pixelpat.streg
VMSYSTEM/ROMS/fib.streg
VMSYSTEM/ROMS/gtt.streg
...

:help
Commands: 
run [arguments]   : SBTCVM command line launcher. use "run help" for help.
asm [arguments]   : SBTCVM assembler. "asm help" for help.</text>

Now that you are at the SBTCVM Command Shell, try typing "help".
Long list? well. lets start with a benchmark. at the command shell, type "run 
-tos benchmark1" Just press enter when SBTCVM tells you to "press enter to exit".
Now, note the operations/second rating. higher is better.
Oh? benchmarks are boring? well. perhaps type "run gtt" to play Guess That Trit.
also... try "list trom" and "list streg". this will show you what programs SBTCVM sees.
Tip: say for VMSYSTEM/ROMS/gtt.streg, just type "run gtt" SBTCVM is 
smart enough to find it.</text>
