	<title>Overview</title>
	<text>SBTCVM's virtual machine, SBTCVM, is the project's namesake
and what SBTCVM's utilities and backend revolve around.  Where even the
computers SBTCVM runs on use binary, SBTCVM uses the rather obscure,
yet elegant, Balanced Ternary.

Naturally, it can seem a bit daunting at first.

	<title>SBTCVM Mark 2</title>
	<text>SBTCVM Mark 2 is the first major revision of the architecture since
the first prototype, and marks the System's move from 6-trit to 9-trit data,
and from 4-trit to 6-trit instructions, but brings other major changes as well.</text>
