	<!--<title>Ghost programs</title>
	<text>Ghost programs are a phenominon related to the que cross-application signaling method.
What a Ghost Program is, is a program that closes after starting another program,
but continues to operate from that program.

A practical use of this is with the shell builtin application, and its special
que signals, in order to create CLI interfaces on the SBTCVM Desktop.</text>-->
	<title>Managing Tasks &amp; Windows.</title>
	<text>Each window visible in the SBTCVM Desktop is a task.

To change windows, click within the desired window, or click the corrisponding
task button in the taskbar. You can also use the mouse wheel over the taskbar
to cycle windows.

To close a window, click the "x" button in the top left corner of the window.

resizable windows have an extra bar at the bottom, that is the same color of the title bar.
This bar can be clicked and dragged to resize that window. Note that some windows will
only resize on one axis.

The task manager, taskman, can be found in the system menu.
To use the task manager click a task in the list, then click either "Close Task" to close
that task, or "Bring To Top" to bring that task's window to the top, and reset its position.</text>
