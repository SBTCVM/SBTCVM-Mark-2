	<text>Ghost programs are a phenominon related to the que cross-application signaling method.
What a Ghost Program is, is a program that closes after starting another program,
but continues to operate from that program.

A practical use of this is with the shell builtin application, and its special
que signals, in order to create CLI interfaces on the SBTCVM Desktop.</text>
