A message from SBTCVM developer: Thomas Leathers

Ever wonder about things?

I do.

It was around the start of June, 2016.

I was wondering about balanced ternary. I had just gotten my
Balanced ternary integer mathematics python library, 
libbaltcalc, up and working,  and a thought crossed my mind:
"I wonder what a balanced ternary Computer would be like?"
Failing my Internet Search skills, I decided to try to write my own.
and today, SBTCVM is already more capable than I could have ever hoped.
Complete with a suite of utility programs, a graphical menu launcher,
and its own assembly language, threading support, and other advanced features, 
SBTCVM Mark 2 has come a long way from a simple idea, 
but still has a long way to go.
