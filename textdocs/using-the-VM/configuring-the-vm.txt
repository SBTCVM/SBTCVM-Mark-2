Configuring The VM:

the VM has a config file:
BOOTUP.CFG

this file has various settings. 


SELECTING ROMS:
see the example lines in the config file. make sure that on multi-rom programs,
you load all roms and load them in the correct slots.

MultiROMs should usually have a letter at the end of each file to show this. 
eg: 'sampleA.trom' or 'SAMPLEa.trom'

there are 6 rom slots. 
labeled a-f.


DEBUGGING:

the default to step-by-step mode is determined here. see comments

CPU SPEED: (measured in seconds to wait per clock tick)

the default CPU speed is determined here. 
usually it should be set at 0.005

if this is too fast for your computer, increase the wait time.

likewise, if your computer can handle more, increase the speed by shortening the wait time.
