draft mode chart for Mark 2.x series:
text modes -xxx range should be text modes, 0xxx & +xxx ranges should be graphics.
ID|code|details
T0|----|648x486 9x9 font

G1|0--0|114x81, 3-trit Greyscale


Issues to be resolved:

Where should the Video Memory Be located? 
  -on a special VRAM bus?
  -mapped directly to the IObus?
  -or otherwise?
How will the text modes be integerated into the SBTGA code?

How will the text modes be made more intelegent?
  -what kinds of control characters should be added to SBTCVM-BTT-6?
  -When Should multi-tryte character codes be introduced?
  -Should The text be stored as Balanced Ternary data?
  -how would a more intelegent text mode system affect SBTCVM Assembly?

When SBTGA is introduced, should we depreciate or remove the 27x27 and 9x9 graphics test areas?

Should The text modes get dedicated memory space for easy modification?
