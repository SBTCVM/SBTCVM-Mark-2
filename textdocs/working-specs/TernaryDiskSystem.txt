Needs:
-Should be extendable.
-Should offer 2 or 3 "removable disk drives"
-not overcomplicated.
-filenames need to be realistic.
-technical concepts need also be realistic.
-mark2 and even the future 12-trit mark3 will only have so much memory.
-we need to fit SBTC-OS's runtime in mark 3's memory too.
