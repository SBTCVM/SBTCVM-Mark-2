SBTCVM IObus System & multi-process Overhaul

goals: 
  -move ALL pygame-related operations out of CPU engine.
  -Move all IObus Operations out of CPU engine.
  -move user Interface and IO out of CPU engine.


Basic Structure:
  -The CPU engine and IObus Engine should be separate processes.
  -The IObus Engine should have control over the CPU engine, given that it will
  handle UI-related events such as user input.


Issues yet to be resolved:

What are the details of the cross-process communication's layout and scheme?


Perhaps Multiple Interfaces might be possible? I.e. Pygame, SDL, GTK, etc.
