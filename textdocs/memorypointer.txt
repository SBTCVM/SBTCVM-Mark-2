registers needed:
memory pointer register. "mempoint"
mempoint, for consistency, should default to "---------", as the exec pointer does.
(we will need to add it to the thread object class and the thread switching code)


operations:
                                                                         | (tasm instruction)
-read to reg 1 using memory pointer                                      | ptread      -0-0+0
-write to memory location using memory pointer and reg1                  | ptwri       -0-0++
-write to memory location using memory pointer and data portion of word. | ptwridat    -0-+--
-memory pointer control.                                                               -0-0+-
  (mode)                      | (control code)| (tasm instrucion.)
  -mode to add a +            | --???????     | ptinc
  -mode to add a -            | -0???????     | ptdec
  -mode to set with reg1      | -+???????     | ptset
-mode to add reg1 to pointer| 0-??????? | ptadd
