Basic Overview for packaging SBTCVM Mark 2

Key Programs:

launcher.py is the central hub for the graphical utilities.

MK2-CS.py is the central hub for the command line utilities.
(its a command shell, so remember to launch it in a terminal or equivalent!)

SBTCVM_MK2.py (the Main VM engine) is not meant to be launched by itself.

icons can be found in VMSYSTEM/GFX

SBTCVM is a balanced ternary virtual machine.

SBTCVM currently requires python and pygame.

NOTE THAT DUE TO THE CURRENT PORTABLE NATURE OF SBTCVM:
ALL OF SBTCVM'S UTILITIES MUST BE EXECUTED IN THE REPOSITORY'S BASE DIRECTORY.

Also, note that users will need to access the base directory as well,
so don't hide it in some obscure location, and perhaps provide some
kind of shortcut to it perhaps?
